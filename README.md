['My advice is to be more analytical and delibrate with your way of thinking, because i think you look at the world in a very narrow minded way.', 'The fact that you cannot prove that the number 1 does not equal the number 2, means that you are acting as if it does equal the number 2, therefore, you are being ignorant of facts and need to develope your way of thinking further by being more delibrate and analytical.', 'I think you are being cognitively dissonant because you are taking a dogmatic approach which will result in you being unreliable.', 'This person needs to understand that cognitive dissonance is a natural part of the human condition. All humans experience it. It is part of being human. It is part of being intelligent.
